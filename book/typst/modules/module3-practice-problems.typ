      /* Here are two component graphs of 
      and an autonomous differential equation.
      Can you draw the phase space. 
      This one might not might not need 
      need cyclical. Or maybe I give have a 
      second part where I change on of the 
      component graphs to be different
      so that it is not possible. Then
      maybe I could have a really hard bonus 
      question where the question becomes possible
      again with more information about the 
      differential equation.
      The example I am thinking of is that 
      I change, in the last part of the question,
      on of the component graphs to be nonciclical
      but in the bonus I give the further
      information that the differential equation 
      can be written in terms of t and is 
      non-dependent on y at all. I believe this is
      enouph to imply on the phase space that you 
      will get spirals that exsume out of the 
      center or spiral into the middle. 
      Maybe ask after how this is different 
      from the error and emphisies how it 
      is very different.*/
