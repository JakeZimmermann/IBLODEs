      A couple of notes Jake had
      while reading the book:
      1. Green ants? Why not make them red or black? Green ants are kinda a hard mental image other than maybe like really small green ones.
      2. 3.222 is not a number of ants.
      Currently it says 3.222! 
      which kinda looks visually like
      222! a very big number. I don't 
      know if this is a big deal, but
      it might be a small deal.
      3. 'An explicit model based on known functions seems a little vague to me. I think what is really trying to be said is that the functions can be written down in a closed form. 
      4. I think that maybe just before defineing what a differential equation is, it might be good to state explicitly that, in this case for $A'(n) = k A(n)$, we already had a model and so writing the differential equation is a bit superfluous. However, in the future we will not be able to write an explicit or recursive model so easily.
      5. I really like the first example. It kinda desribes the thought process one should have when guessing and checking. It might be good to follow up this example with a sanity check question of like "Is this solution the same as the one we had before?" or something like that. I guess right now you kinda do it for them, which is fine too.
      6. Small thing but I think "Solving differential equations" should be called something else like "solutions to differential equations". That is just a bit easier to look up when a student is studying. It also might be a good idea in the section to state right before defining what a general solutions is to state that "There are problems asked more than any other when studying and solving differentatial equations: What is the general solution to this differential equation? and what is the particular solution to this differential equation given this some inital condition? There are respectily two kinds of answers to these questions: a general solution to a differentatial equation that doesn't specify an initial condition, and a specific function that is the solustion to an initial value problem". I am basically saying that there is parhaps room for a into to the ideas of solutions after the first two examples.
      7. I think I am understanding the structure of the book a little more now. I think it might make sense to have a couple of exercises interspersed in the books text as well as at the end of each section. This doesn't currently seem to be the case.
