% Analyze new Phase Portraits
% 1. Give two component graphs of a "solution" and ask them to graph in phase space
% 2. Give a figure 8 in phase space and ask them to draw component graphs so that one loop is traced twice as fast as the other loop
% 3. (a) Can you always go from component graphs to a graph in phase space? What about from a graph in phase space to component graphs? Explain.
% (b) List at least one benefit of (i) component graphs and (ii) graphs in phase space
% 4. Give them the graph from: https://www.desmos.com/calculator/o3xjzddojw
% 
% ask them to identify: (a) where are the equilibria? (b) Classify their
% nature as stable/unstable/etc. How do you know? (c) introduce basins of
% attraction ... (d) Divide the phase space into regions where solutions
% exhibit different natures: where solutions are bounded forwards in time,
% bounded backwards in time, periodic, and unbounded. (e) in which regions
% do the _component_ graphs have asymptotes as t->infty? as t->-infty. (too
% hard? Could the component graphs have vertical asymptotes?)

\begin{objectives}
	In this tutorial you analyze phase portraits in depth.

	These problems relate to the following course learning objectives:
	\textit{Interpret and analyze models based on differential equations using tools like simulation, phase
	portraits, analysis of stability, and linear approximation.}

	\item (Challenge Question)
	The following is a graph in \emph{phase space} of a solution to an unknown system of differential equations
		$V'(t)=\ldots$ and $W'(t)=\ldots$. The solution $\Big(V(t),W(t)\Big)$ graphed below satisfies:
		(i) $V(0)=0$ and $W(0)=-2$ and (ii) $V(t)$ and $W(t)$ are defined for all $t\in \R$.

		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Draw graphs of a possible pair of $V(t)$ and $W(t)$ in \emph{component space}.
			\item The curve shown in phase space can be traced with the parametric equation \[\vec r(\theta)=\mat{5\sin\theta \\ 2{(\cos\theta)}^{1/3}}\]
			with $\theta\in(-3\pi/2 + 0.64, -\pi/2)$.

			Find a parametric equation $\vec q(t)$ so that the curve shown in phase space is traced out by $\vec q(t)$ for $t\in \R$.

			\item Come up with a system of differential equations that satisfy the conditions on $V(t)$ and $W(t)$.

			\item Come up with a second, different, system of differential equations that satisfy the conditions on $V(t)$ and $W(t)$.

	%		\item Where are the equilibrium solutions in the phase portrait? (Can you find all five?)
	%		\item Classify the nature of the equilibrium solutions as stable, unstable, attracting, repelling, etc.
	%		Give a justification for each classification.
	%		\item In phase space, the \emph{basin of attraction of an equilibrium solution $f$} is the set of initial conditions 
	%		 lead where solutions asymptotically approach $f$. For each attracting equilibrium solution, identify its basin of attraction.

	%		\begin{enumerate}
	%			\item Bounded vs. unbounded. 
	%			\item Periodic vs. non-periodic.
	%			\item Have horizontal asymptotes as $t\to\infty$ vs. $t\to-\infty$.
