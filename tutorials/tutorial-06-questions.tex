	In this tutorial you will be exploring the relationship between real and complex solutions to differential equations.

	These problems relate to the following course learning objectives:
			\textit{
				Apply linear algebra techniques to classify solutions of linear systems of ordinary differential
equations including rigorously classifying the stability of equilibrium solutions and creating
linear approximations to non-linear systems of ordinary differential equations}.
		\end{objectives}


\subsection*{Problems}

For this tutorial, you will be using Euler's formula (Not to be confused with Euler's method)
$
	e^{i\theta}=\cos \theta + i\sin \theta
$ and the fact that the complex conjugate of a number $a+bi$ is $a-bi$.


\begin{enumerate}
	\item Consider the differential equation $y''=-y$.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Show that $f(t)=e^{it}$ is a solution to $y''=-y$.
		\item Should the equation $y''=-y$ have a \emph{real} solution? Why or why not?
		\item\label{sin} Use Euler's formula to find the real part of $f$. Is the real part of $f$ still a solution? Justify.
		\item\label{cos} Use Euler's formula to find the imaginary part of $f$. Is the imaginary part of $f$ still a solution? Justify.
		\item The solution space to $y''=-y$ is two dimensional and has a basis $\{e^{it}, e^{-it}\}$. Express your
		solutions to parts \ref{sin} and \ref{cos} in terms of this basis.
		\item\label{realsoln} If a \emph{real polynomial} (i.e., a polynomial with only real coefficients) has a complex solution $a+bi$, then
		the complex conjugate $a-bi$ is also a solution. Suppose that a real differential equation has solutions $e^{(a+bi)t}$
		and $e^{(a-bi)t}$. Prove that this differential equation also has two linearly independent real solutions.
		\item Consider the equation $y'=iy$. Find a solution, $g$, to this differential equation. Is the real part of $g$ also a solution? What 
		about the imaginary part? Explain.
	\end{enumerate}

	\item Let $M=\mat{0&-1\\1&0}$ and consider the differential equation $\vec r\,'=M\vec r$.
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Make a phase portrait for this system. Based on the phase portrait, do you think this solution has real solutions?
			\item Find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of $M$.
			\item The solution space to $\vec r\,'=M\vec r$ is two dimensional. Find a basis of eigen solutions for $\vec r\,'=M\vec r$.
			\item Find a basis of real solutions for $\vec r\,'=M\vec r$.
			\item Is there a real eigen solution to $\vec r\,'=M\vec r$? Why or why not?
